<b> ESP32 can be programmed directly from the Arduino IDE</b> which makes it easy to work for the large community of Arduino developers. Here in this <b> ESP32 getting started tutorial</b>, we will <b> configure ESP32 in Arduino IDE and program it to Blink an LED.</b> So, let’s get started with the ESP32 development board.

## Preparing ESP32 in Arduino IDE
<br>
<b> Step 1<b/> : First you need to download and install <b> Arduino IDE <b/> software which you can download from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software for free. If you have already installed Arduino IDE on your PC, then make sure that it is the latest version of IDE as the older version doesn’t include the ESP32 board.

<br>
<b> Step 2<b/>: After installing, open IDE and go to <b> Files -> Preferences </b> and open preference window and see the <b> “Additional Boards Manager URL’s” </b> as:
